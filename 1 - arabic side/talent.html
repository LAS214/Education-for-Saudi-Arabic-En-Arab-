						<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
						<p>The purpose of manpower planning is to ensure that Alturki acquires and retains the ideal team and empowers them with the required skills, expertise and competencies in a timely and effective manner. Manpower planning requires that the department managers collaborate with the Human Resources Department to maintain current staff levels and plan for the future needs of the business.</p>
						<p><b>Guidelines</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Heads of department are required to analyze the current team capacity before forecasting future recruitment needs. After that, a proposal is made to the Human Resources Department. The process should be conducted by following the standard policy form attached with the policy. All Manpower planning should be completed before December of each year and included in the Budget documents.</li>
							<li>The Human Resources Department is responsible for reviewing the recommendations and building a corporate manpower plan for the financial year.</li>
							<li>The next step is to acquire the official approval of the manpower plan by the Executive Management as per Alturki’s Delegation of Authority Limits document. No change is permitted unless major developments or functional requirements emerge. Any requisition of unbudgeted headcount needs the approval of the President.</li>
							<li>Recruitment should only be carried out in accordance with the basis of operational needs and the approved manpower plan.</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="textHolder">
						<p><b>Guidelines</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>All interviews should be conducted in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If this is not possible for expatriates due to financial or visa restrictions, such interviews may be done abroad in coordination with the HR Department.</li>
							<li>Alturki’s HR Department is accountable to ensure availability of the right talent at the right time for all positions within the Company. This includes new hires, rotations and promotions, extending to offers and salary/package adjustments.</li>
							<li>The HR Department will be responsible for conducting preliminary screenings over the phone before a candidate is invited for an interview.</li>
							<li>The President, CHRO and Chairman shall interview all potential recruits for positions that are held by individuals directly reporting to the President.</li>
							<li>All permanent non-managerial position candidates must be interviewed by at least one HR representative and the vacancy requester.</li>
							<li>Nationalization Policy (Saudization) is a priority.</li>
							<li>Alturki reserves the right to approve employment of relatives of current team members who possess the right skills and qualifications in accordance to business requirements. Relatives may not be employed in the same department or have line authority over one another.  The President must give final approval on such cases.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
						<p>Alturki is committed to ensuring that all positions within the Company are filled with the right talent which may be achieved by developing current employees and recruiting internally as a priority, and/or by recruiting new candidates from the market.  The Company is also determined to enhance its brand as a leading employer and providing a positive experience for all candidates.  Alturki will not discriminate on any basis and believes in providing an open and fair environment that allows all interested candidates equal opportunity to be evaluated against the requirements and specifications of the vacancies available.</p>
						<p><b>1. Sources and Methods </b></p>
						<p>Advertise all open positions and track candidates’ activity using the most appropriate tools in the market.  Three types of sources and methods through which the recruitments are conducted:</p>
						<p>
							A.	Internal Hiring<br/>
							B.	External Recruitment<br/>
							C.	Employee Referrals
						</p>
						<p><b>A.	Internal Hiring:</b>  The purpose of internal hiring is to establish a fair and reasonable framework by which qualified internal candidates can compete for certain career advancement opportunities. The policy supports internal candidates’ development to measure the success of succession planning and company growth.</p>
						<p><b>Guidelines: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>When applying for a position from within Alturki or any of its subsidiaries, all applications will be reviewed by the Talent Management Department. An initial review shall be conducted by telephone before determining if the application will be submitted to the hiring Department.</li>
							<li>All potential candidates must be in their current role for at least 12 months.</li>
							<li>All potential candidates must have at least “Good” performance and not be subject to a formal improvement plan.</li>
							<li>Current managers must be informed about the candidate’s interest to transfer to another position, and coordinate according to the transition time.</li>
							<li>If the candidate is successfully selected, typically a transfer is made within 4 to 6 weeks, however longer or shorter transitions may be required given business needs.</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>

						<p><b>B. External Recruitment:</b>The purpose of external recruiting is to facilitate growth and expand the talent pool. </p>
						<p><b>Talent Pool:</b>The Talent Management Department should build and enhance the talent pool at Alturki by building the database of CVs from the market.  This is an important and valuable tool for improved productivity and career development within the Company. </p>
						<p><b>Third Party Recruitment Agencies: </b>In some cases, it may be necessary to engage a third-party to assist Alturki in locating qualified candidates for an open position.  Agency fees are additive to other staffing charges and are the responsibility of the Hiring Manager, subject to normal internal accounting rules.  Anticipated fees are to be communicated to the Hiring Manager at the time approval is given. Approval as per Delegation of Authority (DoA). </p>
						<p><b>Recruitment Tools: </b>Talent Management Department will also use the following tools and sources for recruitment and placement:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Technical Vocational Centers, Colleges, Universities, Interns and apprenticeship;</li>
							<li>Training programs;</li>
							<li>Job Fairs;</li>
							<li>On-line Applications;</li>
							<li>Sponsorship programs, i.e. Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) program; </li>
							<li>Social Media; </li>
							<li>Advertising. </li>
						</ul>

						<p><b>C. Employee Referrals: </b>Alturki believes that the most valuable resource for finding new talent is in its current team, as they understand the Company’s unique culture and performance expectations that produce a mutually beneficial relationship for the new employee and the Company. </p>
						<p><b>2. Selection</b></p>
						<div class="small"><b>A.	Selection Criteria:</b></div>
						<p>This tool is designed to help interviewers explain the process of a structured interview to candidates and to allow candidates to maximize benefits from interviews.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Ask if the candidate has ever had a structured interview before</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Often candidates will confuse the process with Psychometric testing, so it is important to explain to them what is involved.</li>
									<li>If the candidate says “yes,” then explain that it is still worthwhile to reiterate the process, to ensure the candidate gets the most out of the interview.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<li>
								<b>Explain the core principles</b>
								<ul>
									<li>“I will ask you some questions about situations that you may have faced in the past.”</li>
									<li>“I will ask you to give me a quick overview of what the situation was.”</li>
									<li>“I will then ask you some more detailed questions about the situation in the way of a conversation.”</li>
									<li>“I will ask you to tell me about what you did, rather than what your team did in this situation. It is more important that I understand how you chose to deal with different situations and tasks.”</li>
									<li>“I will leave some time at the end to allow for any questions you may have.”</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Reassure the candidate</b>
									<ul>
										<li>“You may not always be able to think of an example right away, so please take your time to do this.”</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Explain interruptions</b>
									<ul>
										<li>“If I interrupt you at any time of the conversation it is not out of rudeness, rather it is only that I need to clarify something in order to make the best use of our time together. Is this OK?”</li>
									</ul>
								</li>

							</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="small"><b>B.	Candidate Application Screening:</b></div>
						<p>This tool is designed to help interviewers explain the process of a structured interview to candidates and to allow candidates to maximize benefits from interviews.</p>
						<ul>
							<p><b>DOs:</b></p>
									<li>Use a job description to identify the skills and experience required, both of which are critical to the success of the process.</li>
									<li>Challenge the requirements that you have listed; ask yourself the following questions to check if they are valid:</li> <br/>
										<ul>
											<li>Is there any potential requirement that still need to be fulfilled? </li>
											<li>If someone had all of these skills would there still be potential for growth in the role for them going forward? </li>
											<li>Could a person have developed transferable skills in other positions, markets or industries?</li>
											<li>Am I looking for skills that may only reasonably be found within our own environment?</li>
											<li>If a candidate had a great attitude and approach, could they learn the other skills required on the job?</li>
										</ul>
										<br/>
									<li>Strive to broaden the possible pool of candidates whenever possible. Remember that adding requirements is like narrowing an Internet search, eventually you will get to 0 results found.</li>
									<li>Evaluate applications only against the criteria identified in the list of questions you created like the one above. Remember that if it was not essential when you made your list, then it is not essential when you read a resume.</li>
									<li>Be prepared to re-evaluate your requirements based on market availability -- keep an open mind.</li>
									<li>If others are involved with screening candidates, make sure that you have consensus on the job description and the list of essential and beneficial criteria you created.</li>
									<li>Give the candidate the benefit of doubt: the golden rule is “If you are not sure then pick up the phone.”  An initial telephone interview is an excellent way to ensure that you don’t miss good candidates who otherwise would have been rejected purely based on a superficial review of his CV.</li>
									<li>Pay attention to gaps in the resume or inconsistencies, but remember that an often-incorrect assumption results in candidates being removed without foundation. Apply the golden rule.</li><br/>
							<p><b>DONTs:</b></p>
								<li>Don’t screen candidates out of the process for any of the following reasons:</li><br/>
									<ul>
										<li>Layout of resume (there is no “Right” way to create a Resume).</li>
										<li>The fact that a candidate has apparently moved positions often (there are often legitimate reasons for a candidate to have moved which may be out of their control).</li>
										<li>Location (it is a common mistake to assume that a location is an issue; always clarify with the candidate).</li>
										<li>Assumptions made due to lack of detail. For example, if a requirement for filling a project management position is a formal Project Management certification, don’t assume that because the candidate didn’t list it, they don’t hold one. Always check.</li>
										<li>Information contained in any section related to interests outside of the work environment. (Just because someone plays team sports outside work does not make them a team player at work, nor do interests that are not related to team sports mean that an individual will not be a team player in the workplace).</li>
										<li>Race, religion, gender, marital status etc. This is inconsistent with our equal opportunities policy and will expose you to legal risk.  Alturki does not discriminate on any basis, however, we must always give priority to Saudi nationals.</li>

									</ul><br/>
								<li>Don’t screen candidates based on an assumption regarding their right to reside or work in the country in question. Always clarify.</li>
								<li>Don’t consider progressing candidates in the process for reasons that are not related to your list of requirements (e.g. went to same college as me, same interests etc.).  Remain objective and focused on your role.</li>
						 </ul>
						<div class="small"><b>C.	Telephone Interviews- Quick Guide:</b></div>
						<p>This guide has been designed as a quick reference document to help you understand when and when not to use the telephone interview as a selection tool. It also contains some simple Dos and Don’ts to allow you to get the best out of the process. The final section contains some advice on how to initiate a telephone interview with a candidate.</p>
						<div class="small"><b><u>Why use telephone Interviews as a selection step?</u></b></div>
							<ul>
								<li>They are a great opportunity to have a conversation with a candidate in a less formal setting than a face-to-face, on site interview.</li>
								<li>They allow both you and the candidate to ask and answer questions that will help you make an informed decision as to whether a face-to-face meeting would be worthwhile.</li>
								<li>Given that once a candidate comes to an on-site interview there is a much bigger investment both in time and also cost, the telephone interview is an excellent way to ensure that time invested face-to-face will be well spent.</li>
								<li>Candidates typically welcome this kind of approach because it allows them to make an informed decision as to whether or not they should give up more time to explore the opportunity.  The candidate will form an impression about the whole organization based on his or her interaction with you so please remember you representing all of us.</li>
								<li>They allow you to quickly clarify areas of uncertainty about a background or skills match, and therefore reduce the chance of missing good candidates based on incorrect assumptions. They also allow you to identify those candidates who don’t have the required attitude, experience or skills, so that they can be removed from the process.</li>
							</ul>
						<div class="small"><b><u>When should telephone interviews be used?</u></b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>As often as practical</li>
							<li>In circumstances where a face-to-face interview cannot be arranged.</li>
							<li>To clarify any or all of the following:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Gaps in employment history;</li>
									<li>Location questions;</li>
									<li>Willingness to travel if required;</li>
									<li>The role of an individual in a project if not clear; </li>
									<li>Specific level of a skill; </li>
									<li>The scope of a position if not clear; </li>
									<li>Salary/ Benefits expectations; </li>
									<li>Notice Period; </li>
									<li>Terminology that is unfamiliar or specific to an organization. </li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
						<div class="small"><b><u>How should telephone interviews NOT be used?</u></b></div>
						<ul>
							<li>To replace a face-to-face interview. It is an additional step – not a substitute for actual interviews.</li>
							<li>To explore the details with a candidate about the experience and behaviors in the workplace. This should be reserved for the face-to-face interview. Research shows that the validity of structured behavioral interviewing decreases when conducted over the phone.</li>
						</ul><br/>
						<p><b>DO`s:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Read the resume first and have a list of clear and concise questions to ask.  This will make you and our whole Company look professional and attractive.</li>
							<li>Schedule a call if possible rather than “cold-call” a candidate at the workplace.</li>
							<li>Always check that you are talking to the concerned candidate; often a telephone may be answered by a colleague.</li>
							<li>Always check with the candidate that it is convenient for them to talk (e.g. “Hello. This is X from Alturki, before we start I just wanted to check if you are in a position to talk freely?”</li>
							<li>Be aware that international calls with delays can make the conversation stilted and extremely difficult.</li>
							<li>Open up the call by explaining what the purpose is (see advice section below) so that the expectations are clear.</li>
							<li>Allow the candidate to ask you clarifying questions about the role to confirm their interest if required.</li>
							<li>Try to keep the call to 20-30 minutes in duration; this should give ample time to cover any clarifying questions that you may have.</li>
							<li>Give immediate feedback to the candidate. If there is just not enough of a match on both sides from the outset, it is better to communicate this at that time.</li>
							<li>Take clear notes and add to the file.</li>
						</ul><br/>
						<p><b>DONT`s:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Don’t try to explore behaviors; leave this until you see the candidate face-to-face.</li>
							<li>Don’t ask questions that are already answered in the resume, as this will create a very poor first impression.</li>
							<li>Don’t call in a rush.  The candidate will feel hurried that will give a negative impression so make sure you allocate the time properly and focus without distractions.</li><br/>
						<div class="small"><b><u>Advice on Conducting a Telephone Interview</u></b></div>
							<ol>
								<li>Confirm that it is still convenient to talk and that they can do so freely.</li>
								<li>Confirm that you will need about 30 minutes and that this is fine with the candidate.</li>
								<li>Explain that the purpose of this initial call is:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>To have an informal conversation</li>
										<li>To ask some clarifying questions</li>
										<li>To allow the candidate to ask any initial questions that he or she may have. Be sure to be prepared on general information about Alturki that may be relevant.  If you don’t have the answer to a question that the candidate asks please take a note of it and explain that you will get back to them on a specific date and time.  This is extremely important.</li>
										<li>To confirm that the reason we at Alturki like to have initial telephone interviews is because we value the time of our candidates, and want to make sure that there is a good mutual fit before we schedule a face-to-face interview.</li>
										<li>Take clear notes and add to the file.</li>

					</div>
					<div class="textHolder">
						<p><b>Definition</b></p>
						<p>Matrix reporting is when an employee has a second formalized reporting relationship in addition to his or her primary manager “Administrative”. Alturki has created a definition of the Matrix Manger in order to help the organization select the most appropriate to fill the role. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Not all employees will have a Matrix Manager.</li>
							<li>If a team member supports multiple managers, then the Matrix Manager should be the person the team member supports most.</li>
							<li>In cases where multiple Matrix Managers are possible, first consider functional alignment, then business alignment.</li>
							<li>The Matrix Manager has multiple opportunities to assess performance.</li>
							<li>Where a Matrix relationship makes sense, employees can only have one formally identified Matrix Manager.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Managers who have involvement with employees, yet are not officially classified as Matrix Managers, can still provide feedback to employees through conversations with the primary manager. </p>
						<br/>
						<p><b>Roles and Responsibilities of a Matrix Manager</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Create clear alignment on functional priorities and set KPIs</li>
							<li>Provide continuous coaching and feedback to employees throughout the year. </li>
							<li>Collaborate with the primary manager during the goal-setting process before goals are approved.  </li>
							<li>Periodically provide feedback on the employee’s performance to the primary manager to ensure performance expectations and that the team member’s performance against those expectations are clear. </li>
							<li>Provide input and approval of the team member’s annual performance and development.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Matrix Management: Keys to Success </b></p>
						<p>As you coach your managers and team about operating in a matrix management, acknowledge that a matrix environment can be difficult to navigate, but it has definite benefits to the organization: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Alignment and coordination with initiatives that cross businesses, and regions. </li>
							<li>Higher quality performance feedback coming from multiple sources.  </li>
							<li>Better opportunities for career development due to increased visibility to multiple leaders. </li>
							<li>Work with your primary and matrix managers and their teams, to develop skills required to be successful in a matrix environment. Below are a few of those key skills:</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Communicate, Communicate, Communicate</b></p>
						<p>Develop an operating system that establishes regular communication between the team, the primary manager, and the matrix manager to maintain alignment.  Provide updates, listen, inform and escalate as necessary.  Verbal discussions for difficult conversations are best – by phone or face-to-face. </p>
						<p><b>Be Proactive</b></p>
						<p>Take the initiative to raise issues and solve problems. Work with the right people to get things done. Anticipate issues, problems and/or needs and take prompt action to resolve them. Escalate issues as necessary. Be clear in advance about who owns a particular action and leverage the broader network of cross-function, cross business and/or cross-region support where needed. </p>
						<p><b>Align on Business/Customer Priorities</b></p>
						<p>Stay informed about business/regional/function strategies and priorities to manage work and be able to collaborate and problem-solve effectively. Educate one another on relevant business, function and customer needs to raise awareness.</p>
						<br/>
						<p><b>FAQs</b></p>
						<p><b>What is the role of the Matrix Manager during the performance assessment process? </b></p>
						<p>The Matrix Manager plays an active role in the assessment process. The primary manager initiates the performance assessment and then sends the assessment to the matrix manager. The matrix manager can approve or reject the assessment. If the matrix manager does not agree with the primary manager’s assessment, the two managers should have a discussion to resolve the areas of disagreement.  However, the primary manager will have the final say in the matter.</p>
						<p><b>Should the matrix manager participate with the primary manager during a performance review discussion? </b></p>
						<p>No, the primary manager should hold the discussion with the employee. It is best to have this discussion one-on-one. However, the primary manager should incorporate the matrix manager’s feedback in the review, and following the review, the matrix manager should reinforce performance messages and provide continuous coaching to the employee where appropriate.</p>
						<p><b>What do I do if a primary manager and matrix manager do not agree on a team member’s goals or performance assessment?</b></p>
						<p>The first step is for the managers to meet in person or speak on the phone to try to work through their differences. If they are unable to reach an agreement, then they shall facilitate further discussion between them.  </p>
						<p><b>Are matrix managers notified after they have been selected? </b></p>
						<p>Yes, matrix managers are notified via auto-email when they are added or deleted from an employee’s record. The primary manager should have previously contacted the matrix manager to ensure alignment.</p>

						<p><b>Definition</b></p>
						<p>The promotion is to move an employee from his current role to an open and approved vacancy that is at a higher level and accountability.</p>
						<p>To ensure that promotion in Alturki involves a move to a different job with greater responsibilities or increased skill requirements, and not simply a shift to a higher salary level on the basis of length of service; and that there is proper justification to promotion, so that the talented employees of Alturki have a genuine incentive to perform well, and to ensure that promotions are carried out in a timely and professional manner in order to meet business needs.</p>
						<p><b>Our Commitment</b></p>
						<p>Alturki is committed to providing equal opportunities in employment and avoiding unlawful discrimination in the employment process.  Hiring manager should consider sourcing candidates for vacant roles from the widest group possible in order to reach the broadest pool of skills. This requires the support of line managers in these internal applications, in order to help employees succeed with their application and help line managers to plan more effectively.</p>
						<p><b>Guidelines</b></p>
						<p>Whenever vacancies arise, the Heads of Department should consider the possibility of promoting existing employees from within the Company before searching externally.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Employees interested in being considered for an open position should express their interest by applying for open jobs through Alturki Career Pool. </li>
							<li>Selection for promotion should be based on merit with consideration of the following criteria:</li>

								<li>Completed a minimum of one consecutive year (12) months in his/her present position;</li>
								<li>The Talent Management Department can waive the minimum service requirement according to the evaluation of each case;</li>
								<li>In the case of promotion, employees may receive an increase not exceeding a 20% mark up on his/her basic salary to reach the minimum pay scale of the promoted level. </li>
								<li style="list-style-type: none; height: 10px;"></li>
							</ul>
							<li>For promotion recommendation, the Head of Department should complete and forward a Change of Status Form with full justification to the Talent Management Department.</li>
							<li>The Talent Management Department will review the recommendation and ensure that appropriate approval is granted.</li>
							<li>Upon approval of the promotion, the Talent Management Department will prepare a letter incorporating all changes in terms and conditions of employment and send the letter to the promoted employees.</li>
							<li>They are required to sign and return a copy of the letter to the Talent Management Department, signifying acceptance of the new terms and conditions.</li>
